This paper proposes a traffic simulation solution based on micro services simulations. The design is centered
around two types of actors: the city simulation actor and the car which travels across the city. Orchestration is
the key element for handling containers and microservices to bring coherence into their interaction and an
unifying experience to the end user (section IV). The paper presents the results and also enumerates a number of
enhancements which can be further developed around the concept of simulating a city traffic through actors
running in microservices (section VI). Observations:
• I recommend a clearer presentation of the results obtained and of the advantages offered compared to
other solutions.
• There is no correlation between the names of the figures (Fig. ...) and their reference (Figure ...)

- Poor in writing abstract and flow of the paper
- References is not up to date (recent 5 years)
- The paper does not have significant info up to journal level. Only minor technical quality / experiment conducted 
- References need not be cited in the text (as “author name, year”). When they are, they appear on the line, in square brackets, inside the punctuation.
- Review the position of the figure 2 and 3.
